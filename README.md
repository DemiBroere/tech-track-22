## Introduction
The repository is a journey of the tech-track course 2022/2023.

The goal is to create a data visualization based on your chosen API or data, using Javascript, D3, etc. We had to focus on architecture, visualization and/or storytelling. It was very open and free to choose what you'd like to do. I chose to go for the the more visualising and storytelling side. 

You can find more information about the course [ here ](https://github.com/cmda-tt/course-22-23).
